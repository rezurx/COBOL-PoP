## Reporting a Vulnerability

The COBOL PoP Toolkit team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us maintain the security of our users by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via:
- **Email**: security@cobol-pop.com
- **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability in COBOL PoP Toolkit"

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: We will work to develop a fix as quickly as possible
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

## Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security

The COBOL PoP Toolkit implements several cryptographic measures:

#### Hash Functions
- **SHA-256** for Merkle tree leaf and internal nodes
- **HMAC-SHA-256** for selective disclosure commitments
- **Secure random generation** for all cryptographic secrets

#### Merkle Trees
- **Binary tree structure** with configurable fanout
- **Tamper-evident proofs** for data integrity
- **Efficient verification** with logarithmic proof size

#### Selective Disclosure
- **HMAC-based commitments** for privacy preservation
- **Zero-knowledge friendly** construction
- **Selective field revelation** without exposing other data

### Parser Security

#### Memory Safety
- **Rust language guarantees** prevent buffer overflows
- **Bounds checking** on all array accesses
- **Safe binary parsing** with explicit length validation

#### Input Validation
- **Copybook validation** before parsing
- **Data length verification** against record structure
- **Malformed input handling** with graceful error reporting
- **Resource limits** to prevent denial of service

#### COBOL-Specific Security
- **COMP-3 validation** prevents invalid packed decimal exploitation
- **Field boundary enforcement** prevents buffer overruns
- **EBCDIC validation** ensures proper character encoding
- **Record structure validation** before processing

### Dependency Security

#### Rust Crates
We regularly audit dependencies using:
```bash
cargo audit
```

Current security-critical dependencies:
- `serde` - Serialization framework (maintained by Rust team)
- `sha2` - SHA-256 implementation (RustCrypto team)  
- `uuid` - UUID generation (uuid-rs team)
- `chrono` - Date/time handling (chronotope team)

#### Python Dependencies (Orchestrator)
- Regular updates of Python packages
- Virtual environment isolation
- Minimal dependency surface

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected
1. **COBOL data integrity** - Ensure parsed data matches source
2. **Cryptographic proofs** - Maintain tamper evidence
3. **Selective disclosure** - Protect unrevealed fields
4. **System availability** - Prevent denial of service

### Potential Threats
1. **Malicious COBOL files** - Crafted to exploit parser
2. **Corrupted data** - Integrity attacks on input files
3. **Proof forgery** - Attempts to create false proofs
4. **Side-channel attacks** - Timing or memory-based information leakage
5. **Dependency vulnerabilities** - Third-party security issues

### Security Controls
1. **Input sanitization** - All inputs validated before processing
2. **Cryptographic verification** - Proofs validated before acceptance
3. **Error handling** - Secure failure modes with no information leakage
4. **Resource limits** - Prevention of resource exhaustion attacks
5. **Audit logging** - Security-relevant events logged

## Best Practices for Users

### Data Handling
- **Validate copybooks** before processing sensitive data
- **Test with sample data** before production deployment
- **Monitor resource usage** during large file processing
- **Secure key storage** for cryptographic operations

### Deployment Security
- **Run with minimal privileges** - Use least privilege principle
- **Network isolation** - Deploy in secure network segments
- **Access control** - Restrict access to cryptographic keys
- **Audit trail** - Maintain logs of all processing operations

### Development Security
- **Code review** all changes before merging
- **Dependency scanning** before releases
- **Static analysis** with clippy and other tools
- **Testing** including security-focused test cases
